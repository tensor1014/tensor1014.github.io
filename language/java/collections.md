**Inheritance** — an “is a” relationship
**Association** — a “has a” relationship
There are two sub-types of **Association** relationships — **Aggregation** and **Composition**.
**Composition** implies that the contained class cannot exist independently of the container. If the container is destroyed, the child is also destroyed.
With an **aggregation**, the child can exist independently of the parent
